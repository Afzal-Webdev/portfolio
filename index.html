                                I spent four years of my life exploring Computer
                                Science deep down in its core. The story started
                                from the four pillars of Object-oriented
                                programming, moved through the hidden layers of
                                the TCP/IP model fantasizing about modern
                                cryptographic techniques in the picture of
                                <span>Information Security, </span>adding a
                                flavor of Big Data in the form of Hadoop. In the
                                middle of that time frame, managed to raise<span>
                                    seed funding</span
                                >
                                for my first startup from the provincial
                                government applying the lean startup
                                methodology. Played a lot with the Internet of
                                things on Arduino UNO by building several
                                projects, WEB 3.0 and NFTs were not known to the
                                public when I inquired about Merkel trees, the
                                heart of blockchain. Meanwhile, the realm of
                                <span>mathematical philosophy</span> immensely
                                touched my heart and I fell in love with
                                mathematical modeling. Thus started exquisitely
                                with Artificial Intelligence, probed seven
                                wonders of it, and finally graduated by
                                explaining the true essence of
                                <span>mathematical modeling</span> in the
                                context of <span>Neural Networks.</span>
